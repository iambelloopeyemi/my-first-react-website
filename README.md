# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
1. You must return a single parent element in JSX, or it won't compile but in HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element.
2. You can implement JavaScript directly in JSX but this cannot done directly in HTML
3. All self-closing tags must include the slash before the right angle bracket
<!-- 4. ClassName and HTMLFor are used in JSX, as opposed to class and for in HTML -->
<!-- 5. All HTML Attributes  and event references are written in camelCase in JSX -->
<!-- 6. Inline Styles are written as object in JSX  -->

Why can’t browsers read JSX?
JSX is not a valid JavaScript as they are embedded in HTML elements. As JSX is combination of HTML and JavaScript it is not supported by Browsers. So, if any file contains JSX file, Babel transpiler converts the JSX into JavaScript objects which becomes a valid JavaScript. Thus, browsers understands the code and executes. Browsers can’t read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them. JSX is not intended to be implemented by the engines or browsers, it is intended to be used by various transpilers to transform these JSX into valid JavaScript code.
